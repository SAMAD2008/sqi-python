# Project Overview:
# Develop a simple Computer-Based Testing (CBT) program in Python that hardcodes a set of 
# at least 5 objective questions and their answers. The program should ask these questions 
# to the user one by one and display the user's score at the end.

# Requirements:
# Hardcode Questions and Answers:
# Create at least 5 objective questions (multiple choice or true/false).
# Hardcode these questions and their correct answers in your program.
# Question Prompting:
# Prompt the user with each question one by one.
# Allow the user to input their answer for each question.
# Scoring System:
# Compare the user's answers with the correct answers.
# Keep track of the user's score.
# Display Results:
# At the end of the quiz, display the user's total score.
# Sample Questions:
# What is 2 + 2?
# a) 3
# b) 4
# c) 5
# d) 6
# What color is the sky on a clear day?
# a) Red
# b) Blue
# c) Green
# d) Yellow
# How many legs does a spider have?
# a) 6
# b) 7
# c) 8
# d) 9
# What sound does a cow make?
# a) Meow
# b) Bark
# c) Moo
# d) Quack
# What is the opposite of 'hot'?
# a) Warm
# b) Cold
# c) Cool
# d) Boiling
# Sample Execution:

# 1. What is 2 + 2?
# a) 3
# b) 4
# c) 5
# d) 6

# Enter an option from a to d: b

# 2. What color is the sky on a clear day?
# a) Red
# b) Blue
# c) Green
# d) Yellow

# Enter an option from a to d: b

# 3. How many legs does a spider have?
# a) 6
# b) 7
# c) 8
# d) 9

# Enter an option from a to d: c
# Sample Execution Contâ€™d:

# 4. What sound does a cow make?
# a) Meow
# b) Bark
# c) Moo
# d) Quack

# Enter an option from a to d: c

# 5. What is the opposite of 'hot'?
# a) Warm
# b) Cold
# c) Cool
# d) Boiling

# Enter an option from a to d: b
# At the end of the CBT exam, you scored 5 points.
